"# JS-React-Authentication"

Code I am shareing to a friend.

PR and contributions are still welcomed.

Just edit the configuration varibales to at the top.

This is for heartbeat authentication.

Can easily be modified to support JWT.


Note this stores the auth tokens in the chrome local stoare sessions a better approch whould be to run a node.js server then
move that auth sesseion to node.js server before each react client side render.
